# Claude Commands - CountryTV24

Custom slash commands for Git workflow automation and code review in Claude Code.

## ⚡ Quick Reference

| Command | What It Does | When to Use | Version |
|---------|--------------|-------------|---------|
| `/commit` | Create branch + commit | Starting new feature/hotfix | v2.0 ✨ |
| `/quick-commit` | Fast commit on current branch | Iterative development | v2.0 ✨ |
| `/push` | Safe push with validation | Backup work to remote | v2.0 ✨ |
| `/push-pr` | Push + review + create PR | Feature complete, ready for review | v2.0 ✨ |
| `/review-changes` | Quick review of changes | Before committing | v1.0 |
| `/review-pr` | Full PR code review | Review PRs (yours or teammates) | v1.0 |

### 🆕 What's New in v2.0

**Major Improvements:**
- ✅ Branch name sanitization (handles spaces, special chars)
- ✅ Git verification on all commands
- ✅ Smart defaults and fewer questions
- ✅ Better error handling and debugging
- ✅ Faster workflow with streamlined inputs

**See**: [COMMAND_IMPROVEMENTS.md](COMMAND_IMPROVEMENTS.md) for details

### 🎯 Common Workflows

**New Feature**: `/commit` → code → `/quick-commit` → code → `/push-pr` → merge
**Quick Fix**: `/commit` → fix → `/quick-commit` → `/push-pr`
**Backup Work**: `/quick-commit` → `/push`
**Review PR**: `/review-pr` → give feedback

### ⚠️ Important Notes

**Before Using Commands:**
- ✅ Git must be installed (`git --version`)
- ✅ Must be in a git repository (`git status` works)
- ✅ For `/push-pr`: GitHub CLI required (`gh --version`)
- ✅ Branch names with spaces will be sanitized automatically

**Command Safety:**
- 🔒 Commands never push without confirmation
- 🔒 Always validate before executing
- 🔒 Won't commit files with secrets (.env, credentials)
- 🔒 Warn about protected branches (main, master)

## 💡 Tips & Best Practices

### Git Workflow
1. **Use `/commit` for new work** - Creates branches and sets you up
2. **Use `/quick-commit` for iterations** - Fast commits on same branch
3. **Use `/push` when ready to backup** - Safe push with validations
4. **Use `/push-pr` when feature is complete** - Push + PR in one command
5. **Review the summary carefully** - Claude shows what changed before actions

### Code Review
6. **Use `/review-changes` before commits** - Catch issues early
7. **Use `/review-pr` for all PRs** - Get thorough analysis
8. **Use `/push-pr` for instant reviews** - Combines push + review + PR
9. **Learn from reviews** - Claude explains WHY, not just WHAT
10. **Review your own PRs** - Get a second opinion before merging

### Best Practices
11. **Never push directly to main** - Always use feature branches
12. **Keep commits small** - Easier to review and revert
13. **Write good descriptions** - `/push-pr` helps with this
14. **Fix issues before PR** - Use `/review-changes` first
15. **Use conventional commits** - All commands follow this format

### v2.0 Improvements
16. **Branch names auto-sanitized** - "Spotify Integration" → "spotify-integration"
17. **Press ENTER for defaults** - Faster workflow in `/push-pr`
18. **Smart base branch detection** - hotfix/* → main, feature/* → develop
19. **Optional code review** - Choose full/quick/skip in `/push-pr`
20. **Fewer questions** - Commands are streamlined for speed

## 🤖 Automatic PR Reviews

In addition to manual reviews with `/review-pr`, you can set up **automatic code reviews** that run when you create or update a Pull Request on GitHub.

### How It Works

1. You create/update a PR on GitHub
2. GitHub Action automatically triggers
3. Claude AI analyzes the code changes
4. Review comment posted to your PR (30-60 seconds)

### Setup

See **[.github/CLAUDE_REVIEW_SETUP.md](../../.github/CLAUDE_REVIEW_SETUP.md)** for complete setup instructions.

**Quick setup**:
1. Get Anthropic API key from [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/)
2. Add as GitHub secret: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
3. Push the workflow files (already in `.github/workflows/`)
4. Create a PR to test!

**Cost**: ~$0.05 per PR review (very affordable)

### Manual vs Automatic Reviews

| Feature | `/review-pr` (Manual) | GitHub Action (Automatic) |
|---------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| Trigger | You run command | Automatic on PR create/update |
| Location | Claude Code IDE | GitHub PR comments |
| Speed | Instant | 30-60 seconds |
| Cost | Free (uses your Claude Code) | ~$0.05/review (Anthropic API) |
| Best for | Quick local checks | Team collaboration, CI/CD |

**Recommendation**: Use both!
- `/review-pr` for quick local reviews before pushing
- GitHub Action for team reviews and CI/CD gates

## Customization

To modify these commands, edit:
- `.claude/commands/commit.md` - Full workflow
- `.claude/commands/quick-commit.md` - Quick workflow
- `.claude/commands/review-pr.md` - PR review
- `.claude/commands/review-changes.md` - Changes review

For automatic reviews:
- `.github/workflows/claude-code-review.yml` - GitHub Action
- `.github/scripts/claude-review.js` - Review logic

See [Claude Code Docs](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code) for more info.

---

## Troubleshooting

**Command not found?**
- Make sure files are in `.claude/commands/` directory
- Restart Claude Code
- Check file has `.md` extension

**Wrong branch created?**
- Use `git checkout main` to go back
- Delete unwanted branch: `git branch -D branch-name`

**Want to modify commit message?**
- Before confirming, tell Claude: "Use this message instead: [your message]"

**Need to uncommit?**
- `git reset --soft HEAD~1` - Uncommit but keep changes
- `git reset --hard HEAD~1` - Uncommit and discard changes (dangerous!)
