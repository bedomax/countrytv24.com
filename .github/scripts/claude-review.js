**Error**: ${error.message}

The automated code review could not be completed.

## Possible Causes

1. **Missing API Key**: Make sure \`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\` is configured in GitHub Settings → Secrets → Actions
2. **API Quota Exceeded**: Check your Anthropic account usage at https://console.anthropic.com/
3. **Network Issues**: GitHub Actions may have connectivity problems
4. **Model Unavailable**: The Claude model may be temporarily unavailable

## How to Fix

1. **Check API Key**:
   - Go to GitHub repo Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
   - Verify \`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\` exists and is valid
   - Get a new key from https://console.anthropic.com/

2. **Check Workflow Logs**:
   - Go to Actions tab → Failed workflow → "Run Claude Code Review" step
   - Look for specific error messages

3. **Manual Review**:
   - Use \`/review-pr\` command in Claude Code IDE
   - Or review the PR manually
